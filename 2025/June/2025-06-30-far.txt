>>> How do the Lebanese Forces ministers implement US dictates? - SOUTH LEBANON — Concern is growing over the U.S. position to renew the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon at the end of August, given the American pressure that only serves the interests of the Israeli enemy.

>>> Iran's response to Israel averted regional war: Pezeshkian - TEHRAN – In an address to the Eurasian Economic Forum, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian talked about the precarious situation that unfolded in the wake of Israeli aggression against Iran, noting that had Iran not effectively responded to the regime’s attacks, the whole region would have been dragged into an all-out conflagration.

>>> Israel requested end to hostilities after Iranian retaliation: FM Araghchi - TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Thursday that the Israeli regime was forced to end its 12-day war of aggression against Iran “out of desperation” and with no preconditions, following a wave of Iranian retaliatory strikes that inflicted severe damage across the occupied territories.
