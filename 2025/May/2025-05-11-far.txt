TEHRANTIMES
>Trump’s looming Riyadh visit and regional power dynamics

>TEHRAN- President Donald Trump is embarking on his first international trip of his second term, returning to Saudi Arabia—a symbolic echo of his 2017 debut on the world stage. The visit, however, unfolded against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions, including the ongoing Gaza conflict, the uphill Iran nuclear negotiations, and shifting alliances. 

>A response to claims of ‘imminent collapse’ in Iran

>TEHRAN – Daniel M. Rosen, in his recent article for the Jpost, argues that Iran is on the brink of collapse, citing economic hardships posed by U.S. sanctions, evolving situation in the West Asia region, and what he calls internal discontent. However, predicting the Iranian government’s imminent downfall overlooks historical resilience, strategic recalibrations, and Tehran’s evolving regional posture.

>Witkoff dims prospects for nuclear agreement as he demands concessions on Iran’s red lines

>TEHRAN – President Donald Trump’s special West Asia envoy Steve Witkoff dampened hopes for a potential breakthrough in indirect nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington ahead of a fourth round of the discussions, as he told a U.S. news outlet that Iran should “dismantle” its uranium enrichment facilities and ship the material “far away”.

>Why is Nasrallah’s mausoleum defamed!?

>BEIRUT — A week has passed since Lebanon’s Al Jadeed channel aired an intelligence report aimed at defaming the mausoleum of Hezbollah’s martyr Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, without the Lebanese government lifting a finger at this seditious media outlet.

>Yemen to enforce Israeli airspace ban

>TEHRAN – Yemeni forces launch operations to block commercial air travel in Israeli skies in solidarity with Gaza.

>Persian Gulf: Our waters, our lands

>TEHRAN – A land or body of water can hold diverse meanings. The Persian Gulf, for example, is a vital waterway for global oil transport, an exotic destination for tourists, and a geostrategic location for military forces. But for those who have thrived along its shores for thousands of years, it's a heritage, heritage so deeply ingrained, so fiercely its own, that no flood of propaganda or political maneuvering can ever truly wash it away.

>India and Pakistan agree to a ceasefire

>India and Pakistan on Saturday agreed to a ceasefire following U.S.-led talks to end the most serious military confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades, AP reported.
