TEHRANTIMES
>77 years of resistance against Nakba

>CAIRO - Within the context of the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict, the 1948 war-later known as the Nakba-stands as the most tragic and consequential starting point in the modern history of the Middle East.

>While the 1948 Nakba is still bleeding, Gaza is facing a second Nakba

>TEHRAN - May 15, 2025, marks the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, a catastrophe that forcibly uprooted over 750,000 Palestinians and erased more than 500 villages in 1948. However, this tragedy is not limited to the past; it continues to reverberate in the present, particularly in Gaza. 

>Remembering Nakba: cinematic stories of displacement, hope

>TEHRAN – Since 1948, when the United Nations officially recognized the state of Israel, the issue of land seizure and the displacement of Palestinian inhabitants has remained a central and tragic theme. 

>Mortopolitics: a book in progress

>TEHRAN – What you are reading is an excerptfrom Kurosh Alyani's unpublished book about Israel’s war on the people of Gaza.

>Palestine’s ongoing Nakba

>BEIRUT — The Nakba in Palestine in 1948 marked a turning point in West Asia. It was no less dangerous than what happened at the end of World War I, particularly for the Islamic Ummah, as the Zionist entity was established to serve global imperialism.

>Palestinians resisting another Nakba

>TEHRAN – Why the resilience of Palestinians will prevent another Nakba amid unprecedented war crimes in Gaza.
