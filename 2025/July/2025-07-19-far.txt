TEHRANTIMES
>>> 'How many Iranian women did you kill with those bombs?' - TEHRAN – Israel likely believed it would rally the public support it failed to gain during the 12-day Iran-Israel war by sharing pictures of a female Israeli soldier writing "Mahsa Amini" on munitions destined for strikes against Iran. However, the move provoked mixed reactions—but not support—with many Iranians now questioning Israel’s role in the 2022 violence that shook Iran.

>>> Syria’s bloody events: Dividing the divided - BEIRUT— Given the March horrific massacres on the Syrian coast and recently in Suwayda has it become legitimate to ask that partition is becoming a reality in Syria? The mosaic of partition is leading to the construction of de facto authorities that are separate and isolated from each other. 

>>> Israel’s aggression in Syria fuels drive to ‘change the Middle East’ - TEHRAN — The recent resurgence of violent clashes between Druze fighters and Bedouin tribes in Syria’s southern Suwayda province has once again been cynically exploited by Israel to justify its hostile interventions in the country.

>>> Don't count your chickens before they hatch: War surprises for Netanyahu, and by extension for Trump - TEHRAN- At midnight on Friday, 13 June 2025, just two days before a new round of Iran-U.S. negotiations to diplomatically resolve the Iranian nuclear issue, Netanyahu launched a surprise attack on Iran that had been years in the making.

>>> Under US orders, Banque du Liban demonizes Al-Qard al-Hassan - BEIRUT — The Banque du Liban has announced banks and financial institutions subject to its license are prohibited from dealing with Al-Qard al-Hassan, Hezbollah’s solidarity association.

>>> The 'post-Iranian Middle East' proposed by Israel - MADRID – At a time when stability and sovereignty have become almost existential issues countries in West Asia, Amos Yadlin’s article “The Post-Iranian Middle East,” published in Foreign Affairs, perfectly encapsulates a kind of political arrogance masked as academic analysis. Far from offering a roadmap to peace, the piece by the former Israeli general reads more like an obituary for regional autonomy.

>>> Israel’s covert plans against Iran in progress: report - TEHRAN – Following its failure to create internal unrest or fragment Iran’s territorial integrity during the recent 12-day war, the Israeli regime has moved to implement three new psychological and political operations targeting the Islamic Republic.
